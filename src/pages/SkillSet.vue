      <p>As a trainee at LTIMindtree, I've had the valuable opportunity to enhance my technical skills through a well-structured and thorough training program. With a educational foundation in computer science, I initially built a solid skill base. However, my journey at LTIMindtree has been instrumental in not only refining my existing skills but also in expanding my expertise. This experience has enabled me to excel in various domains, including:</p>
      
          * Java<br>
          * Mysql<br>
          * SpringBoot<br>
          * Vue JS<br>
          * Spark and Kafka<br>
          * Python
